# CeaCipher
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption methods. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the text is replaced by another, shifted by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. There are still modern applications that use a similar mechanism, such as the ROT13 scheme.
